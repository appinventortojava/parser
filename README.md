parser
======

Translator for yail files to java.

Once the parser has been updated, you will need to create a runnable jar, with appinventor project as the main. And call it yail-to-java. And place it in the appinventor/libs/yava/ folder. Then it's just a matter of updating the buildserver. 

See appinventor readme on how to update buildserver
